## Identification and Classification of flowers using Deep Learning

## Overview:

This project focuses on the identification of different species of flowers using advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging image classification models, this project aims to accurately categorize flowers based on their visual characteristics.

## Features:

Image Preprocessing: Clean and prepare flower images for analysis.
Model Development: Build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using optimization techniques like VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet50 to classify flowers.
Live Identification: Implement a user-friendly interface using Gradio, allowing users to identify flowers in real-time through webcam or image upload.
Performance Evaluation: Assess model accuracy and performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.
Visualization: Display results and predictions through informative plots.

## Results:

The model achieves high accuracy in identifying flower species, with detailed evaluation metrics available for analysis.
